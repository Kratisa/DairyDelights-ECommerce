Cart Functionality:

A core feature of the application is its interactive cart system. Users can add products to their cart with a single click, with each product displaying its name, price, and quantity. The cart dynamically updates to reflect the total cost and number of items as products are added or removed. Users can also increase or decrease product quantities directly from the cart, making it easy to manage their selections without navigating away from the product pages. This functionality enhances the user experience by providing a straightforward way to control their shopping decisions.

The hero section grabs users' attention, while product grids present items in a clear and organized manner. Additional features, such as a slider for promotional images or featured products, enrich the visual experience. The cart modal, which displays when users interact with the cart icon, is designed for clarity and ease of use, ensuring that users can quickly review their selections before proceeding to checkout. Overall, the project combines aesthetic design with practical functionality to create an enjoyable shopping experience that encourages user engagement and satisfaction.
